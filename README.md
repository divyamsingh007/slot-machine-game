Slot Machine Game – My first Node.js project! This command-line slot machine marks the beginning of my Node.js journey. It simulates betting, spinning reels, and calculating winnings—all through terminal input. A fun and interactive way to learn about logic building, input handling, and modular design in a backend environment!
